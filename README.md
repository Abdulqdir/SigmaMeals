We are using Heroku for deployment and since we are on free version our webstie doesn't run 24/7. the first time you click on the link above if you get 404 wait for 3 to 4 minutes and try again. our free version doesn't have 24/7 active server so it needs to run and start the server if no one runs the website for few hours.
